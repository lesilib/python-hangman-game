# python-hangman-game
You can run this in an IDE or in your terminal/shell. (You must include the "wordslist" module as it is required for the main script.)
Alternatively, replacing wordlist.words in the main script with the tuple in the wordlist module would also work.
This is a simple hangman game with 1000 possible words. You have 6 chances to guess the word.
